# Piano Music Modes

Explore, visualize, and listen to musical scales and modes—turn theory into something intuitive, visual, and fun.

---

## What is this?

An interactive playground for learning and exploring **musical modes, scales, and theory** using a virtual piano.  
Pick any tonic, see the full major scale, inspect all modes (Ionian, Dorian, etc.), **hear and see notes**, and analyze intervals and formulas.  
Coming soon: **game modes** for hands-on practice.

---

## Main Features

- **Tonic Selector:** Choose any root note.
- **Scale Table:** Breaks down degree, note, interval, and formula (T, ST, etc.).
- **Modes Table:** Switch between modes and see the reconstructed scale, reflecting the correct interval pattern.
- **Interactive Piano:** Highlights current scale/mode notes and lets you play and listen.
- **Theory Visualization:** See the jumps/steps between notes and the active formula.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and ARIA.
- **Robust Testing:** Musical logic, components, and UI are covered.

## What’s next?

- **Game Mode:**  
  Crossword/drag-and-drop/puzzle games to build scales and modes. Practice solfège and theory in a playful way.
- **Notation options:**  
  Toggle between sharps/flats depending on context.
- **Didactic aids:**  
  Tips to understand “rotating” vs “rebuilding” modes.
- **Support for more scales and exotic modes.**
- **Advanced audio/MIDI controls.**

## How to use

1. **Pick a tonic** (root note).
2. **See the major scale** breakdown.
3. **Switch modes** to see how the scale transforms.
4. **Interact with the piano** to listen and visualize highlighted notes.
5. _(Coming soon)_ Play and learn with musical minigames!

## Tech Stack

- **React** (TypeScript, hooks)
- **Tone.js** (audio/synthesis)
- **Jest** + **Testing Library** (unit and UI tests)
- **CSS Modules** (component-level styling)

---

## Development & Testing

- Modular, well-tested musical logic and UI.
- Unit and integration tests for all components.
- Accessibility and keyboard interaction included.
- Open to contributions: new games, modes, educational features, etc.
