# Piano Music Modes

**Playing with musical modes (D tonic, D scale)**

---

## Overview

This project is an interactive visualizer for musical modes using a piano interface. You can explore how different modes (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian) affect the notes of a scale, with D as the tonic. The app highlights the notes on a virtual piano and lets you listen to each mode.

## Features

- **Interactive Piano:** Highlights notes for the selected mode.
- **Mode Table:** Shows buttons for each mode, their description, and the notes.
- **Ear Training Synth:** Uses Tone.js for clear, practical sound.
- **Note Name Display:** Option to always show note names.
- **Error Highlighting:** Visual feedback for incorrect notes (if needed).
- **Alternative Notation:** Shows flat equivalents for black keys.

## Development & Testing

- All musical mode logic is tested (`src/utils/toMusicalMode.test.ts`).
- Piano rendering and interaction are tested (`src/PianoBase/PianoBase.test.tsx`).
- App integration and mode switching are tested (`src/App.test.tsx`).
- Tone.js is mocked for tests to avoid Web Audio API issues.
